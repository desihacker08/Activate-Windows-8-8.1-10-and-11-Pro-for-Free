<img src="windows demo.webp">
Note: This method requires you to have a Microsoft account connected! This is the method most people may use as this one activates it PERMANENT. If the below steps aren't working, try to download the batch file manually (.cmd and .bat are both the same) from [here](https://github.com/dasiboyz/Activate-Windows-8-8.1-10-and-11-Pro-for-Free/blob/Coad/File/Windows.bat) by opening the link and pressing Ctrl+S to save the file. After that run the .cmd file manually as administrator and you're already at final step, 7!
1. Press <kbd><img src="/icon/icons8-windows-11-100.png" width="20"></kbd> + `R` to open the Run menu.
2. Enter 'powershell' in the box of the Run menu.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`.
4. In the PowerShell window, enter the following command and press `Enter`: `irm https://get.activated.win | iex`
5. Wait until the window for the activation tool pops up.
6. Choose the option for HWID Activation by pressing the key associated with it.
7. Wait until it completes. It might give an SKU value error, but it will complete successfully. If it doesn't try again a few times and it should work.
